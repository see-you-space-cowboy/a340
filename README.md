Re create the ECU signals to the transmission computer using an ardunio. This is great for stand alone fuel injection, engine swaps or altering the stock signals to the transmission to hold gears longer or downshift sooner. I have included the code and how to wire it up. The car 12v is very dirty. Use a 12v to usb converter directly to battery with a 1000 uF capacitor between positive and negitive. Code will need to be altered to your application. If hunting occurs increase hysteresis. Keep in mind the Aisin transmission computers want to see 0 and 12v You will need to use a break out board with relays. The 5v signal will switch the relays to turn on/off the 12v signal from vehicles power. Please subscribe to beatupbuilds on youtube.
