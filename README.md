Re create the ECU signals to the transmission computer using an ardunio. This is great for stand alone fuel injection, engine swaps or altering the stock signals to the transmission to hold gears longer or downshift sooner. I have included the code and how to wire it up. The car 12v is very dirty. Use a 12v to usb converter directly to battery with a 1000 uF capacitor between positive and negitive. Code will need to be altered to your application. If hunting occurs increase hysteresis. Please subscribe to beatupbuilds on youtube.
